This project was created to demonstrate a single-page application built with React and Next JS. The app includes CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more. The functionality implemented in this project is specified by the RealWorld [API spec](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api).

## Demo

A live demo avaliable here: [DEMO](https://realworld-nextjs.vercel.app/)

The exact same Medium.com clone (called Conduit) is here: [Couduit](https://demo.realworld.io/)

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
